  https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/wiki


Installation
------------

Please see the documentation link above for detailed written and video 
instructions on installation and use.

The basic installation is as follows:
- Extract the distribution archive (zip or tgz).
- Copy the NARPNet_NCS dir in to your FLDIGI macros dir.
- From the NARPNet_NCS dir in the FLDIGI macros dir, run setup.bat (Windows)
  or setup.sh (Linux)

IMPORTANT: Don't press the Edit macro buttons until you have configured them
according to the documentation referenced above.  Otherwise FLDIGI will crash.


Overview
--------

These macros are intended to make it as simple as practical for NCS's to run the
NARPNet Digital Net.  Making it simple is helpful in promoting more NCS's to
help shoulder the load of running a reliable weekly net.

A macro file for the net exists to reduce typing and to define a standardized
flow of the net.  The macros basically chop the flow of the net into little
pieces, some of which are used multiple times in a row -- like asking if there
are any more check-ins.

These macros were patterned after those distributed by AmRRON.  The net flow
defined in the NARPNet NCS macros was patterned after both AmRRON and SEEN nets.
Also, the NARPNet NCS macros are more tailored to having a team of NCS operators
rather than a single operator.
