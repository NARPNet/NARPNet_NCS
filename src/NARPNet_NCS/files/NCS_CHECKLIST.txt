NCS CHECKLIST TO PREPARE FOR NET
--------------------------------

Try to be fully prepared at least 30 min before the net and be ready to accept 
early check-ins at least 15 min before net.


[ ] Prepare NCS traffic.  NCS should have traffic if possible.  It doesn't have
    to be much.  Just an AmRRON SITREP or something.  This can be done at any
    time before the net.

[ ] Check the AmRRON AMCON level at https://amrron.com/ and update the
    AmCON_Level.txt file if necessary.

[ ] Verify proper station operation.
    1. Tune around the band and make sure you can hear other signals.
    2. Check antenna SWR by TXing on low power and watching SWR meter on radio.
    3. Set radio power level and filters appropriately.
    4. Start FLDIGI and make a test transmission on net frequency and mode.
    5. Make sure you can hear RX audio and, if possible, the TX audio.  This
       helps you hear DUPs, avoid DUPs, hear wrong modes, band noise, static
       crashes, and lets you know that your own signal sounds right.
    6. Do something with a digital mode involving another station to make sure 
       others can hear you. Checking Winlink mail works, or sending a JS8Call 
       heartbeat on the main JS8 frequency and making sure you see replies. 

[ ] Give the Net Start warning at least twice starting at least 10 minutes 
    before the net starts.
