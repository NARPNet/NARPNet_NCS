# NCS Macros for the NARPNet Digital Net

Documentation is in the **[Wiki](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/wiki)**.

There are also **[Video Instructions](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/wiki/5.-Video-Instructions)**.

## Overview

These macros are intended to make it as simple as practical for NCS's to run the
NARPNet Digital Net.  Making it simple is helpful in promoting more NCS's to
help shoulder the load of running a reliable weekly net.

A macro file for the net exists to reduce typing and to define a standardized
flow of the net.  The macros basically chop the flow of the net into little
pieces, some of which are used multiple times in a row -- like asking if there
are any more check-ins.

These macros were patterned after those distributed by AmRRON.  The net flow
defined in the NARPNet NCS macros was patterned after both AmRRON and SEEN nets.
Also, the NARPNet NCS macros are more tailored to having a team of NCS operators
rather than a single operator.

## Current status

**This is a work in progress.**  

Just my first draft of a set of macros.  I am learning more and more about
FLDIGI and macros as I do this.  Things will definitely change.  Maybe
drastically.

We need discussion among others interested in being NCS operators to end up with
a generally acceptable set of macros.  Please use the Discussions area of this
repo for that.  If there are any actual bugs, please talk about them in
Discussions first and then report an Issue if necessary.  To participate in
Discussions or file Issues, you must have a GitHub account.

You can [download the latest
pre-release](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/releases/latest/).  Look
under Assets and ignore the source code zips.

Please report your experiences in the GitHub Discussion area or via email to
lobanz@protonmail.com.  Thanks!
