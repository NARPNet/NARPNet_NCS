# NCS and Operator Macros for the NARPNet Digital Net

Version 1.0.0 FINAL is expected in a month or so. You can [download the latest
pre-release](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/releases/latest/).  Look
under Assets and ignore the source code zips.

Documentation is in the **[Wiki](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/wiki)**.

There are also **[Video Instructions](https://github.com/NARPNet/NARPNet_NCS/wiki/5.-Video-Instructions)**.

Net Schedule:
- Monday evenings at 7:00 PM CST (01:00Z).
- 3.591 USB @ 900 on the waterfall.
- FLDIGI starting in THOR22, THOR32 for traffic.
- SEEN/AmRRON-style net but we don't use the NWOTW.

## Overview

These macros are intended to make it as simple as practical for NCS's to run the
NARPNet Digital Net.  Making it simple is helpful in promoting more NCS operators
to help shoulder the load of running a reliable weekly net.  

A macro file for the net exists to reduce typing and to define a standardized
flow of the net.  The macros basically chop the flow of the net into little
pieces, some of which are used multiple times in a row -- like asking if there
are any more check-ins.

Also included are general purpose macros for participants that make it easy to 
tune into the net, check-in, send traffic, etc.  These can be used in other 
digital nets as well.

These macros were patterned after those distributed by AmRRON.  The net flow
defined in the NARPNet NCS macros was patterned after both AmRRON and SEEN nets.
Also, the NARPNet NCS macros are more tailored to having a team of NCS operators
rather than a single operator.

## Current status

**This is a work in progress.**

The current pre-release is in active use in the net and has been for several months.

Version 1.0.0 FINAL is expected in a month or so.

The macros will inevitably change as we better understand the realities of 
running a net and as we better understand our own requirements.
