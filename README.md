NCS Macros for the NARPNet Digital Net

## Current status

*This is VERY preliminary at this point.*  Just my first draft of a set of macros.
We need discussion among others to end up with a generally acceptable set of
macros.  Please use the Discussions area of this repo for that.  If there are
any actual bugs, please talk about them in Discussions first and then report an
Issue if necessary.

## Overview

These macros are intended to make it as simple as practical for NCS's to run
the NARPNet Digital Net.  Making it simple is helpful in promoting more NCS's
to help shoulder the load of running a reliable weekly net.
